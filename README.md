## QMK files

This is all of my QMK files for my 42-key corne keyboard.

Animation files are from [Marek Piechut's repo](https://github.com/marekpiechut/qmk-animations)
instructions on how to use them can be found in there.

Layout is still much work in progress, so it might change quite frequently.

Preview will be added some time in the future (probably never).

## Goals 
- **Support colemak-dh english layout and default russian layout**

    It works by having separate qwerty layer and having macro which toggles between
    layers and also presses `LGUI + Y` to switch system language, which is my 
    keymap for doing that.

- **Have miryoku-esqe feel to layout meaning have minimal hand contortions when
activating different layers**

- **Have bottom row mods as needed**

    I don't want to have my mods on the home row as I can't really get used to
    feel of delay when pressing them. Which is annoying for me especially on custom
    layouts such as colemak where home row keys used quite often.

    So moving them to bottom row makes it feel much better.
